# Tic-Tac-Toe Using Minimax Algorithm

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe-app! I built this application using front-end library called react. I seen many tic-tac-toe projects on the internet but I tried something different and implement Minimax Algorithm for other player (i.e., The CPU).

## More About Minimax

Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player.

## Build Guide
